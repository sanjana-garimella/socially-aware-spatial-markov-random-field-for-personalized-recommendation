## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **top-N item recommendation system** using a **Socially-Aware Bayesian Markov Model** that leverages a **Markov Random Field (MRF)** to incorporate opinions from socially connected neighbors in a **trust network**. 

The model uses **Bayesian-inspired Logistic Regression** with **35 features**, including:
- **Review characteristics:** price paid, timestamp, review text length
- **Social network features:** trust relationships, PageRank scores, centrality measures
- **Engineered interaction features**

**Key Challenge:** Handles extreme sparsity (99.99%) and cold-start scenarios where traditional collaborative filtering fails.

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented

Three models were compared using **AUC** to evaluate their ability to rank items users would rate highly (≥4 stars):

### 1️⃣ Jaccard Similarity (Baseline)
- Memory-based collaborative filtering
- User-user and item-item similarity
- No content or social features
- **AUC: 0.4997** (essentially random)

### 2️⃣ Bayesian Logistic Regression
- Uses 3 review features: price, time, review text length
- Probabilistic model for rating prediction
- **AUC: 0.5830**

### 3️⃣ Social Bayesian Markov Model ⭐
- Combines Bayesian Logistic Regression (35 features) + MRF social smoothing
- Incorporates trust network to propagate preference signals
- **AUC: 0.6248** (~25% improvement over baseline)

## 📂 Dataset

**Epinions Dataset** from Shopping.com consumer reviews:

**Review Data:**
- 50,000 reviews
- 39,719 users
- 11,197 items
- **Sparsity: 99.99%**
- 85% of users have only one review

**Trust Network:**
- 84,516 users
- 1,159,338 directed trust edges
- Mean in/out degree: 13.72

This extreme sparsity makes it ideal for studying **cold-start problems** in recommendation systems.

## 📈 Performance Results

| Model                   | AUC Score |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Jaccard Similarity     | 0.4997    |
| Bayesian               | 0.5830    |
| Social Bayesian Markov | **0.6248** |

## 📚 Comparison with Literature

Inspired by ["Scalable Recommendation with Social Influence and Sequential Modeling" (IJCAI 2017)](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/ijcai17a.pdf).

| Model | AUC Score |
|-------|-----------|
| Bayesian (Paper) | 0.53 |
| Sequential Markov + Social Bayesian (Paper) | 0.58 |
| Bayesian (Our Project) | 0.58 |
| **Socially-Aware Spatial Markov (Our Project)** | **0.6248** |

**Key Insight:** Our spatial Markov approach outperforms the paper's sequential model by ~6% for top-N recommendations by better capturing item correlations rather than just sequential patterns.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- ✅ Collaborative filtering fails under extreme sparsity (performs like random guessing)
- ✅ Probabilistic models provide significant gains in sparse settings
- ✅ Social trust information dramatically improves recommendation quality
- ✅ Combining content + behavior + social structure yields best performance
- ✅ Spatial Markov modeling > sequential for top-N recommendations
